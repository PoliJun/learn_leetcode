## List and Set

The main difference between `vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']` and `vowels = {'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'}` is that the first one creates a **list** and the second one creates a **set** in Python¹². A list and a set are both data structures that can store multiple values, but they have some important differences:

-   A list is an **ordered** collection of values, which means that the values are stored in a specific sequence and can be accessed by their indices¹². A set is an **unordered** collection of values, which means that the values are stored in no particular order and cannot be accessed by their indices¹².
-   A list can have **duplicate** values, which means that the same value can appear more than once in the list¹². A set can only have **unique** values, which means that there can be no duplicates in the set¹².
-   A list is **mutable**, which means that the values in the list can be changed, added, or removed after the list is created¹². A set is also **mutable**, which means that the values in the set can also be changed, added, or removed after the set is created¹².
-   A list can store any kind of values, including other lists or sets¹². A set can only store **hashable** values, which means that the values must be immutable and have a unique hash value¹³. For example, a list can store another list as a value, but a set cannot store another set as a value.

Some examples of how to create and use lists and sets are:

```python
# create a list of vowels with square brackets
vowels_list = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']

# access the first element of the list by its index
print(vowels_list[0]) # a

# append a new element to the end of the list
vowels_list.append('y')
print(vowels_list) # ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u', 'y']

# create a set of vowels with curly braces
vowels_set = {'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'}

# check if an element is in the set with the in operator
print('a' in vowels_set) # True

# add a new element to the set with the add method
vowels_set.add('y')
print(vowels_set) # {'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u', 'y'}
```

## `self` key word in python

-   introduce the self key word of python:
    > Sure. The `self` keyword in Python is used to refer to the current instance of a class. It is a special parameter that is passed to all methods of a class, and it can be used to access the attributes and methods of the current instance.
    >
    > For example, the following code defines a class called `Person`:
    >
    > ```python
    > class Person:
    >  def __init__(self, name, age):
    >    self.name = name
    >    self.age = age
    >
    >  def say_hello(self):
    >    print("Hello, my name is {} and I am {} years old.".format(self.name, self.age))
    > ```
    >
    > The `__init__()` method is called when a new instance of the `Person` class is created. The `self` parameter is passed to the `__init__()` method, and it is used to initialize the attributes `name` and `age` of the new instance.
    >
    > The `say_hello()` method also takes the `self` parameter. This parameter is used to access the attributes `name` and `age` of the current instance.
    >
    > When the `say_hello()` method is called, the `self` parameter is bound to the current instance of the `Person` class. This means that the `self.name` and `self.age` attributes refer to the attributes of the current instance.
    >
    > The `self` keyword is a very important part of object-oriented programming in Python. It allows you to access the attributes and methods of the current instance, and it is essential for creating and using classes.
    >
    > Here are some additional things to keep in mind about the `self` keyword:
    >
    > -   The `self` keyword is always the first parameter of a method in a class.
    > -   The `self` keyword cannot be used as a variable name outside of a class.
    > -   The `self` keyword is a convention, and it is not a reserved word in Python. You can use another name if you want, but it is not recommended.
    >
    > I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
-   can self be omitted in python?
    > No, `self` cannot be omitted in Python. It is a special keyword that is used to refer to the current instance of a class. If you omit `self`, the interpreter will not know which instance of the class you are referring to, and your code will not work.
    >
    > There are some people who argue that `self` is unnecessary and that you can just use the name of the class instead. However, this is not recommended, as it can make your code more difficult to read and understand.

    >    self.age = age
    >
    >  def say_hello(name, age):
    >    print("Hello, my name is {} and I am {} years old.".format(name, age))
    > ```
    >
    > This code will not work, as the `say_hello()` method does not have a `self` parameter. The interpreter will not know which instance of the `Person` class to use, and the code will not compile.
    >
    > To fix this, you need to add the `self` parameter to the `say_hello()` method. The modified code would look like this:
    >
    > ```python
    > class Person:
    >  def __init__(self, name, age):
    >    self.name = name
    >    self.age = age
    >
    >  def say_hello(self):
    >    print("Hello, my name is {} and I am {} years old.".format(self.name, self.age))
    > ```
    >
    > This code will work, as the `self` parameter is now used to refer to the current instance of the `Person` class.
    >
