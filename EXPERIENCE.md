## Steps to solve a problem

1. Guess:
    > For example:
    > _Container With Most Water_ problem, need to traverse the array, then you should consider _two pointers_.
2. Analysis the instructions:
    > Choose an already known mature algorithms as a paradim. Then optimize this problem.
3. Analyze the algorithm's _time complexity_ and _space complexity_

## Two aspects to analysis the problem:

1. paradim
2. instructions

## Sliding Window

This algorithm's point is to find out the condition where to do the left += 1.

## stack

-   When to consider this algorithm?
    > when traverse an array with single direction, and pop the last element when meet some conditions.
